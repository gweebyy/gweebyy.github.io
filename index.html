    <h1>Vivian Header :] YAY</h1>

    <p>I have been playing <strong>Pokemon Heart Gold</strong> again and I think that it has been really fun. 
       I will probably go back and play some of the older games, because the newer ones just don't interest me.
       While yes, there is better and stronger technology so that 3D models and scenes can be rendered for the games,
       I feel that it just lost its original charms with the pixelated little sprites. There were a lot of new things introduced with terrestrialization
       or mega evolutions and what not, but it never really interested me much after the first couple times I saw it.
